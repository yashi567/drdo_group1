possession of which has been delivered in pursuance of section 20 of the Displaced Persons
(Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954 (44 of 1954), shall be primarily leviable upon the
transferee.]
(2) If any land has been let for a term exceeding one year to a tenant and such tenant has built upon

amount of rent payable in respect thereof to the person upon whom under the provisions of section 120
the said taxes are leviable, that person shall be entitled to receive from his tenant the difference between
the amount of the property taxes levied upon him and the amount which would be leviable upon him if
the said taxes were calculated on the amount of rent payable to him.
(2) If the land or building is sub-let and its rateable value exceeds the amount of rent payable in
respect thereof to the tenant by his sub-tenant, or the amount of rent payable in respect thereof to a subtenant by the person holding under the sub-tenant, the tenant shall be entitled to receive from his subtenant or the sub-tenant shall be entitled to receive from the person holding under him, as the case may
be, the difference between any sum recovered under this section from such tenant or sub-tenant and the
amount of property taxes which would be leviable in respect of the said land or building if the rateable
value thereof were equal to the difference between the amount of rent which such tenant or sub-tenant
receives and the amount of rent which he pays.
(3) Any person entitled to receive any sum under this section shall have, for the recovery thereof, the
same rights and remedies as if such sum were rent payable to him by the person from whom he is entitiled
to receive the same.
122. Recovery of property taxes from occupiers.—(1) On the failure to recover any sum due on
account of property taxes in respect of any land or building from the person primarily liable therefor
under section 120, the Commissioner shall recover from every occupier of such land or building by
attachment, in accordance with section 162 of the rent payable by such occupier, a portion of the total
sum due which bears, as nearly as may be, the same proportion to that sum as the rent annually payable
by such occupier bears to the total amount of rent annually payable in respect of the whole of the land or
building.
(2) An occupier from whom any sum is recovered under sub-section (1) shall be entitled to be
reimbursed by the person primarily liable for the payment, and may in addition to having recourse to

from time to time becoming due from him to such person.
123. Property taxes a first charge on premises on which they are assessed.—Property taxes due
under this Act in respect of any land or building shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue, if

delay.

account of a tax may be recovered from him by a suit in any court of competent jurisdiction.
161. Power of seizure of vehicles and animals in case of non-payment of tax thereon.—(1) If the

tax has become due, seize and detain the vehicle or animal or both and, if the owner or other person
entitled thereto does not within seven days in respect of a vehicle and two days in respect of an animal
from the date of such seizure and detention, claim the same and pay the tax due together with the charges

any rent due or falling due from him in respect of the land or building to the extent necessary to satisfy
the portion of the sum due for which he is liable under the said section.

have been paid and satisfied and the occupier shall be entitled to credit in account with the person to
whom such rent is due for any sum paid by him to the Corporation in pursuance of such notice:
Provided that if the person to whom such rent is due is not the person primarily liable for payment of
the property tax, he shall be entitled to recover from the person primarily liable for the payment of such
tax any amount for which credit is claimed as aforesaid.

owner, acquire such land in addition to the land within the said line and such surplus land shall be deemed
to be a part of the public street and shall vest in the Corporation.

building to be so set forward in the case of reconstruction thereof or of a new construction.
Explanation:—For the purpose of this section a wall separating any premises from a public street

owner in consequence of any order made by the Commissioner:
Provided that:—

land so acquired formed part, likely to accrue from the setting back to the regular line of the street

the owner, the Commissioner may recover from him half the amount of such excess as a betterment
charge.
(2) If in consequence of any order to set forward a building made by the Commissioner, the owner of
such building sustains any loss or damage, compensation shall be paid to him by the Commissioner for

forward.

93

(3) If the additional land which will be included in the premises of any person required or permitted
under sub-section (2) to set forward a building belongs to the Corporation, the order or permission of the
Commissioner to set forward the building shall be a sufficient conveyance to the said owner of the said
land; and the price to be paid to the Corporation by the owner for such additional land and the other terms
and conditions of the conveyance shall be set forth in the order or permission.
